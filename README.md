# Daily Boost

## Goals of this app

Daily Boost is an app to help us through our day here at Hack Reactor. The concept is pretty straight forward: the user clicks on a button to get a little pick me up in the form of a quote, joke, or kick in the butt. Additionally, users will be able to contribute to the database to help motivate each other.

- Quotes will be stored in a mongo database
- I'll interact with this databse via mongoose
- The front end will be constructed using react
- The server side will be constructed using express on top of node

## How am I going to make this work?
